# node-get-weather
Small app to get location weather from the OpenWeatherMap API

To use the app, run it using `node index [locations]`.

The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the temperature for the selected locations and gives them to you in the terminal.

A location can either be a city or state name or a US zip code.
